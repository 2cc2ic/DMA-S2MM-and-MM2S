Note: Setting this value to zero disables the delay timer interrupt.

At the completion of the S2MM transfer, the number of actual bytes written on the S2MM AXI4 interface is updated to the S2MM_LENGTH register.
Note: This value must be greater than or equal to the largest expected packet to be received on S2MM AXI4-Stream. Values smaller than the received packet result in undefined behavior.
